# Inflation Calculator

An inflation calculator

## Instructions

- Enter the price of the item
- Enter the tax rate
- Enter 1 to find future prices, 2 to find past prices
- Enter the year you want to know the price in

### Example

If you enter the following information:

- Price: $100
- Year paid: 2022
- Year you want to know the price in: 2023

The output will be $104.50.

## How it works

With provided inputs, it calculates the price of the item in the past or future
corresponding to inflation - in this case, is 4.5% year over year.
Using the simple Rule 72, which at the moment means the price of an item
doubles roughly every 16 years, we'll get the year over year rate of 4.5%.
